# Python-challenge
I worked on this for hours and just couldn't figure out a couple things.
In PyBank, the dates of the greatest increase and decrease are off by one row, and I have no idea why. And for both the projects, I could never get them to print to a text file. It kept saying it couldn't find the directory, even though it was the same path as the python file.
In PyPoll, I couldn't figure out how to get the percentages to show with the main list of names and total votes.
I've been looking at it so long, I can't think of another way to approach it.
